# WWTP Influent Generators

This repository contains the different WWTP influent Generator Model developed between [Lund University](https://www.iea.lth.se/) and [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.kt.dtu.dk/english/research/prosys). Two implementations are currently available  


This implementation is the BSM2 influent generator developed by Krist V. Gernaey, [Xavier Flores-Alsina](https://github.com/xfalsina), Lorenzo Benedetti, Christian Rosen and [Ulf Jeppsson](https://github.com/ulfjeppsson). The model is described in the following paper authored by the model developers: [Dynamic influent pollutant disturbance scenario generation using a phenomenological modeling approach](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2011.06.001). This version of the model was developed in MATLAB 2019b and it can be run in said instance of MATLAB or newer versions.

This is the BSMSewer based influent generator model developed by Ramesh Saagi, Sofia-Lovisa Andersson, Erik Lindblom and Ulf Jeppsson. The model is described in the following papers authored by the developers  

This version of the model was developed in R2017a and it can be run in the said instance of MATLAB or newer versions
