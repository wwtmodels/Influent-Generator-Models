# WWTP Influent Generators

This repository contains the different WWTP influent Generator Model developed between [Lund University](https://www.iea.lth.se/) and [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.kt.dtu.dk/english/research/prosys) 

The only available implementation is the BSM2 influent generator developed by Krist V. Gernaey, [Xavier Flores-Alsina](https://github.com/xfalsina), Lorenzo Benedetti, Christian Rosen and [Ulf Jeppsson](https://github.com/ulfjeppsson). The model is described in the following paper authored by the model developers: [Dynamic influent pollutant disturbance scenario generation using a phenomenological modeling approach](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2011.06.001). This version of the model was developed in MATLAB 2019b and it can be run in said instance of MATLAB or newer versions.
