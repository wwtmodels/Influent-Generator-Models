# WWTP Influent Generators

This repository contains the different WWTP influent Generator Model developed between [Lund University](https://www.iea.lth.se/) and [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.kt.dtu.dk/english/research/prosys). Two implementations are currently available  

<strong>BSM2 Influent Generator</strong>  
This implementation is the BSM2 influent generator developed by Krist V. Gernaey, [Xavier Flores-Alsina](https://github.com/xfalsina), Lorenzo Benedetti, Christian Rosen and [Ulf Jeppsson](https://github.com/ulfjeppsson). The model is described in the following paper authored by the model developers: [Dynamic influent pollutant disturbance scenario generation using a phenomenological modeling approach](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2011.06.001). This version of the model was developed in MATLAB 2019b and it can be run in said instance of MATLAB or newer versions.

<strong>BSMSewer Influent Generator</strong>  
This is the BSMSewer based influent generator model developed by Ramesh Saagi, Sofia-Lovisa Andersson, Erik Lindblom and Ulf Jeppsson. The model is described in the following papers authored by the developers  
[Saagi, R. (2017), Generating Wastewater Treatment Plant Influent Data for Realistic Evaluation of Future Scenarios - Case Study for WWTPs in Stockholm, Sweden. Technical report, Division of Industrial Electrical Engineering and Automation, Lund University](https://www.iea.lth.se/publications/Reports/LTH-IEA-7268.pdf)

This version of the model was developed in R2017a and it can be run in the said instance of MATLAB or newer versions
